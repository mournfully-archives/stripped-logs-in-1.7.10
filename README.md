If you wish to try it out, you can download the latest version from the releases tab on the right side.

For now, there isn't any way to obtain them through crafting or in-world actions. I've just been spawning them in through creative mode whenever I needed them. Oh, and also I think there was an issue with log textures changing to different types of trees or something along those lines. I'm not sure if I every got around to fixing that, it's been a while and I've already gotten bored of minecraft and for the most part stopped gaming altogether lol.

Not gonna lie, this playlist was a godsend and I'm so glad I found it. MrCrayFish's videos still apply to this day albeit with minor changes that can be found in the comments. They are wonderful for learning the basics of modding.

I learned where to find the "Referenced Libraries" for minecraft from this. It was great being able to actually reference working code instead of having to work by trial and error.
